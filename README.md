Band diagram  and Field of 2D photonic cristal

This program solves the Helmholtz's equation in a 2d periodic lattice using the Plane Wave Equation (PWE) method.
The lattice can have a square or hexagonal periodicity. Whatever pattern can be build inside the primitive cell.

Four structures are available:
-> Square lattice
-> Hexagonal lattice
-> Honey comb lattice
-> DFB structure
